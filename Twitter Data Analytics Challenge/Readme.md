# Twitter Data Analytics Challenge

This project is part of a comprehensive data challenge I encountered on Twitter. The dataset, **Metaverse Financial Transactions**, provides a realistic set of data for exploring anomaly detection, fraud analysis, and predictive analytics in a virtual environment.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains blockchain financial transactions within the open metaverse. It aims to provide a rich, diverse, and realistic set of data for developing anomaly and fraud analysis models, as well as prescriptive analytics.

## Challenge Questions
The tasks involved in this challenge span multiple tools and platforms, testing a wide range of data analytics skills:

1. **SQL**  
   Write an SQL query to identify potential fraudulent transactions by comparing the average transaction amount of each sending address to its individual transactions. Highlight those transactions where the amount exceeds the average by more than two standard deviations.

2. **Excel**  
   Using Excel, describe how you would create a predictive model to identify transactions with a high-risk score. Include the steps for data preparation, model creation, and validation. Specify the Excel functions or add-ins you would use.

3. **Python**  
   Write a Python script using `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a transaction is an anomaly. Include steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

4. **Power BI**  
   Describe how you would create a Power BI dashboard to monitor transaction patterns and predict high-risk transactions using historical data. Outline the key visualizations you would use and how to implement a predictive model in Power BI.

5. **Tableau**  
   Explain how you would visualize the likelihood of fraud across different age groups and regions using Tableau. Describe the steps to create a predictive model within Tableau and how you would present the results to highlight high-risk areas.
